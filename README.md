# Sequence-Analyzer
Bioinformatic tool for sequence analyzing (DNA, RNA, protein) with user interface. 

Using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment and Dot Matrix algorithm to present data.
Sequence can be entered manually, downloaded form NCBI database or by reading FASTA file.
User can write to file the output data.

Using Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignment. Note that local alignment works only for DNA sequences in this implementation.
