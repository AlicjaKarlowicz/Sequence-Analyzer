# Sequence-Analyzer
Bioinformatic tool for sequence analyzing. 
Using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment and Dot Matrix algorithm to present data.
Sequence can be entered manually, downloaded form NCBI database or by reading FASTA file.
User can write to file the output data.

In progress: adding Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignment.
